# Live Coding Interview Project

This repository contains the source code developed during a **live coding interview**.  
The primary goal of this project was to demonstrate problem-solving skills, coding style,
and the ability to structure a Symfony + Docker based application under time constraints.

## Features
- Symfony framework setup with Docker environment
- Example domain structure (entities, config, migrations)
- Basic tests and tooling configuration
- Initial CI-friendly project layout

## Notes
This project is **not intended for production use**.  
It was created solely for interview purposes and may lack certain optimizations,
error handling, or security hardening.
